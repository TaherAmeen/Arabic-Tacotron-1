# Arabic-Tacotron-1
This is a modification to [youssefsharief/arabic-tacotron-tts](https://github.com/youssefsharief/arabic-tacotron-tts) project.

## What is new
- Prepended a layer of vocalization to the predection model, from the [Shakkala project](https://github.com/Barqawiz/Shakkala/) so there is no need to write 'Harakat' within the input text
- modified some hyperparameters

## What is next
- training the model on a new dataset that is larger and clearer than the already existing one.
- making my own vocalization model
